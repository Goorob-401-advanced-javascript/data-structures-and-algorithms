# Challenge Summary
  create a linked list class with insert and include and to string function 

## Challenge Description
insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency

all the functions have been created
