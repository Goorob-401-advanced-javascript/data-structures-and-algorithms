## repeated word

## Challenge :
- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time
The time efficiency is O(n2)
space
The space efficiency of this algorithm is O(n), as it depends on the number of words in the input string.
