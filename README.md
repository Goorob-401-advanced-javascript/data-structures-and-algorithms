# Binary Tree and BST Implementation 
## challaenge Summary 
Create a BinaryTree class , Create a BinarySearchTree class

## Challenge Description
 Create a BinaryTree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Create a BinarySearchTree class
- Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
 
## Approach & Efficiency
