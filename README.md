Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree
## Challenge Description
Write a function  which takes binary tree as its only input., return the maximum value stored in the tree. assuming that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric
 

## Approach & Efficiency

Time :The time efficiency of this algorithm is dependent on the size of the tree: O(n).
Space :The space efficiency is dependent on the depth of the tree .
