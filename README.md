# Singly Linked List
## challange summary 
create a linked list then create a method that do what supposed  to do then test it . 

## Challenge description
-Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
-Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
-Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
-Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
the approach that i used is linked list approach that have class format and while loop
 - insert() takes added new node to the list with an O(1) Time performance.
 - includes() return true or fales with an O(1) Time performance.
 - toString() return list as string formate with an O(1) Time performance.
