# Stack and Queue 
## challange summary 
stack is a type of data structure that is linear where order is conserved. For many people, stack is known to have a LIFO (Last In First Out) mechanism .
queue is a linear data structure where it obeys the FIFO (First In First Out) mechanism.

## Challenge description
1. create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
- Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
- Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
- Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
1. Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
- Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
- Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
- Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
- Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
The Big of O is o(1) for all the method
