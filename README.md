# Queue-with-stacks 
## challange summary 

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge description
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class , this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue , but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. 
- enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.

## Approach & Efficiency
only take up O(1) at most and for space it should be O(n) .
